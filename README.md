This is actually a java exam that was given to us. We were asked to create a springboot app with a one to many relationship as a team of four. 
The actual work is actually a springboot tutorial i got from YOUTUBE and did it. I've been able to gain some really good knowledge with it
...and surely looking forward to learning more about springboot in the near future.
